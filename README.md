<h2> 11. The importance of doing your own work</h2>

<p>I aim to better my skill so that my work would add value to the company that I will one day work for and while I'm still in my infant stages of coding it would be “damn silly” to copy or plagiarize work. Long term it will cause a lot of issues with my employer's work satisfaction and could lead to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. That is not something I want!
 Taking time to fully understand the concepts would be a good idea because I'll be able to stand on my own two feet and have the ability to help others or lead future projects which will feel like a reward or achieving a long term goal.</p>
